  NOTES
</h2>

<p align="center">
  The main section of the app is used for small notes/reminders that aren't too complicated to save, tasks that need no longer explanation than a few words, maximum of 3 is recommended, but there is no limit to it. 
</p>
  
<h4 align="center">
  These tasks can be anything, for example:
</h4>
  
<h6 align="center">
  Take out trash
</h6>
  
<h6 align="center">
  Clean room
</h6>

<h6 align="center">
  Pay bills
</h6>
      
<h6 align="center">
  Wash the car
</h6>

<h2 align="center">
  ADDING NOTES
</h2>
  
<p align="center">
  By clicking on the "+" button, you are redirected to the input section of the app where you can ADD a new note with a deadline date and a type which represents the area of life you have the task on.
</p>

<h2 align="center">
  EDITING NOTES
</h2>

<p align="center">
  By clicking on any note, you are redirected to the input section of the app with the note's settings where you can change it's title or type. You can't change the date of it though, if it would be that case you would be more comfortable to post-pone any task. So for tasks which's deadline changed(unfortunately) outside of your control zone, you need to CREATE a new note.
</p>

</p>


<h2 align="center">
  LISTS
</h2>

<p align="center">
  The second section of the app can be accessed by the bottom navigation items, that way you are transferred to the lists section where you can store more "routine-like" tasks like a shopping list, a workout routine, your bill deadlines or even the car's inspection dates.
</p>

<p align="center">
  You can CHECK every item once completed that specific task or check all by the bottom left element. To DELETE items in a list you need to check them, then press the bottom right element, so every checked item gets deleted. And for removing lists, just navigate back to the lists section and you can delete them with the right side element.
