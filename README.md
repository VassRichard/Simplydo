Simplydo! - Your simple to-do & shopping list!
Simplydo is here to increase your productivity, so at the end of the day you can enjoy your free-time without the worry of the tasks that remained undone!

The application is focused on simplicity and efficiency.  
With a minimalist & user-friendly design and on-point mechanism, the application provides every feature, for every person, as a small note taking application.  
Simplydo's goal is to increase the users task-completion efficiency throughout the day, helping with day-to-day tasks, be that simple reminders or more like a "routine style" list, Simplydo has got you covered!

The application consists mainly of 2 different interfaces.  

* As the application starts you are presented with the 1st interface that shows you the notes you have saved or NONE if you weren't a potato. 
* With a press ( on the + ) button you are redirected to the input screen where you can set a title, a date for it and optionally, you can set a category image to remind you of the life-area you are working on ( thought it was cute to add :3 )
* Beware, once you set a date you can't change it, you will do it or you won't so you have to delete the note and remember that you were a lil' lazy potato for that task  

You can access the 2nd interface by switching it via the bottom navigation menu, that's where your lists are hiding.

* With the input bar, you can add a list and by pressing on your list of choice, you enter the input interface where you can change the lists name by clicking in the title area or add items in your list, using the input bar on the top and by either pressing on the **+** or the Android phone's **"SEND"** button.
* You can mark ( using the button on the bottom left ) the items that you completed to keep track or you can delete them by selecting certain items then click on the **"X"** button on the bottom.

**The app doesn't have ADS and it's not because I am kind, it's because I didn't figured how to add them yet ;)**
